## Q1
What other components can an image be decomposed to other than albedo and shading?

## Q2
Because given an image I = R x S, the solution is ill-posed, there is no unique solution for
R and S.

#Recoloring

## Q3
Because the shading component is not uniform, thus shifting the color after composition.
